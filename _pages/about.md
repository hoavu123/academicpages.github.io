Hi! I am an Assistant Professor in Computer Science at <a href="https://www.sdsu.edu/">San Diego State University</a>. 

My current research focuses on the design and analysis of algorithms with an emphasis on problems that arise in streaming and distributed settings. Some topics include graph algorithms, approximation algorithms, and sketching algorithms. 

For more details, check out my [research papers](publications), [CV](/files/CV.pdf), and [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=C3qZIn8AAAAJ&hl=en). 

I completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science at the [University of Massachusetts, Amherst](https://www.umass.edu/), where I was fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Andrew McGregor](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~mcgregor/).  I also spent a year as a postdoc at [Boston College](https://www.bc.edu/), working with Prof. [Hsin-Hao Su](https://sites.google.com/site/distributedhsinhao/).
