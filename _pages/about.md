This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the respository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads! An older version of this template powers my own personal website at [stuartgeiger.com](http://stuartgeiger.com), which uses [this Github repository](https://github.com/staeiou/staeiou.github.io).

## Hoa T. Vu
I am an Assistant Professor in Computer Science at [San Diego State University](https://www.sdsu.edu/). 

My current research focuses on the design and analysis of algorithms with a focus on problems that arise in streaming and distributed settings. Some topics include graph algorithms, approximation algorithms, and sketching algorithms. 

For more details, check out my [research papers](papers.html), [CV](CV.pdf), and [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=C3qZIn8AAAAJ&hl=en). 

**Brief bio**: I completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science at the [University of Massachusetts, Amherst](https://www.umass.edu/), where I was fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Andrew McGregor](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~mcgregor/).  I also spent a year as a postdoc at Boston College, working with Prof. [Hsin-Hao Su](https://sites.google.com/site/distributedhsinhao/).
